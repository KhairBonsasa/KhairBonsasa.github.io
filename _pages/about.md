I am a geospatial professional with a strong foundation in Geographic Information Sciences (GISciences) and a passion for applying spatial technologies to solve real-world problems. I hold a Master of Science in GISciences from Saint Louis University and a Bachelor of Science in Political Science from Harris-Stowe State University. My work blends geospatial data analysis, remote sensing, programming, and simulation—bridging the gap between field-based data collection and high-resolution digital insight.

My experience spans both research and operational settings. As a Geospatial Data Analyst at the Taylor Geospatial Institute, I supported agricultural research by designing and managing geospatial databases, performing UAV-based image acquisition, and developing repeatable workflows for remote sensing data processing. I used tools like ArcGIS Pro, ENVI, Python, and Trimble GNSS equipment to generate deliverables for scientific and industry partners.

I’ve also worked with Radar and finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulation softwares, to explore subsurface features such as root structures and buried infrastructure. My research aimed to enhance the accuracy of volume estimation through multi-frequency fusion, 3D data stacking, and image segmentation techniques—laying the groundwork for more advanced applications of machine learning in radar interpretation.

Beyond research, I’ve supported campus-wide IT infrastructure as a specialist, assisted in public safety sensor reprogramming, and participated in NGA-sponsored internships focused on urban vegetation analytics and geospatial intelligence. I’ve presented work at GEOINT, Geo-Resolution, and the Maxar Innovation Challenge.

I am particularly interested in the intersection of GIS, AI/ML, and system design for cities, infrastructure, and national defense. Whether building simulations, creating field-ready maps, or developing automated pipelines, I strive to make spatial technologies more accessible, efficient, and impactful.

Currently, I’m seeking opportunities where I can contribute to data-driven decision-making—be it through city planning, intelligence analysis, or technical R&D—while continuing to advance my skills in geospatial analytics, machine learning, and application development.
