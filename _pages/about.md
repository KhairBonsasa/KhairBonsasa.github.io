I am a **PhD student in Signal and Image Processing** at **Laboratoire CREATIS (UMR 5220)**, **Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1**, **INSA-Lyon**, **CNRS**, and **Inserm**. My research explores the fusion of **Deep Learning and Computer Vision** for **3D image segmentation and registration**. 

I graduated **Summa Cum Laude** from the [Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence](https://www.javeriana.edu.co/maestria-inteligencia-artificial) at **Pontificia Universidad Javeriana** and was honored as **Valedictorian** in my [Biomedical Engineering Bachelor's](https://www.escuelaing.edu.co/es/programas/ingenieria-biomedica/). My research interests include **image processing, computer graphics, data analysis, and machine learning-based biomedical applications.**
